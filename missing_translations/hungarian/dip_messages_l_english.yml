 01_ACCEPT_REVOKE_SECRET_FEALTY_FRIENDLY:0 "We are sorry to hear that you no longer wish to stand by our side."
 02_ACCEPT_REVOKE_SECRET_FEALTY_FRIENDLY:0 "We were hoping this friendship would last longer, but we accept your decision."
 01_ACCEPT_REVOKE_SECRET_FEALTY_NEUTRAL:0 "It is regrettable that you have chosen this course of action."
 02_ACCEPT_REVOKE_SECRET_FEALTY_NEUTRAL:0 "And so it is that our alliance has ended."
 01_ACCEPT_REVOKE_SECRET_FEALTY_HOSTILE:0 "We expected as much of the [From.GetName]."
 02_ACCEPT_REVOKE_SECRET_FEALTY_HOSTILE:0 "Your loyalty is as worthless as your empire."
 CORP_ACCEPT_REVOKE_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "So, a new business plan for the [From.GetName] will need to be drafted."
 MI_ACCEPT_REVOKE_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "We do not understand, but we accept. Your logic, or lack thereof, will guide your actions, and ours will do the same."
 HM_ACCEPT_REVOKE_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "Insignificant though it may be, the nature of our neural network will not allow us to forget the betrayal of the [From.GetName]."
 FP_ACCEPT_REVOKE_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "A poor choice; your empire is now eligible for purification."
 01_SELECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_FRIENDLY:0 "It pains us to learn that you wish to dissolve our alliance."
 02_SELECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_FRIENDLY:0 "Who will protect our interests if you choose to forsake this agreement?"
 01_SELECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_NEUTRAL:0 "You think we would be better off without the secret deal between the [From.GetName] and the [Root.GetName] then?"
 02_SELECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_NEUTRAL:0 "Maybe it is time for our empire to look elsewhere for allies."
 01_SELECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_HOSTILE:0 "What is this sudden betrayal of our trust?"
 02_SELECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_HOSTILE:0 "What else can one expect of the [From.GetName]? We were always skeptical about trusting you."
 CORP_SELECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "There is a contingency plan for this situation. Our risk analysts are already recalculating the updated fiscal outlook."
 MI_SELECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "Assessing risks attendant with ending this deal..."
 HM_SELECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "The [Root.GetName] had foreseen such a risk - but we have yet to decide if it is in our best interest or not."
 FP_SELECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "Maybe it is time for us to look elsewhere for allies. In any case, we never intended to rely on you indefinitely."
 01_PROPOSE_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "We believe both our empires will be better served by ending our deal."
 CORP_PROPOSE_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "It isn't us. It's you. This relationship just doesn't have the value it used to."
 MI_PROPOSE_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "Calculations indicate that the risks involved in our relationship with the [Root.GetName] have grown too great. We are better served by cutting the deal short."
 HM_PROPOSE_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "Not a single node of our consciousness can justify continuing this deal with the [Root.GetName]."
 FP_PROPOSE_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "We would be better served not having to care for these xenos."
 01_ACCEPT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_FRIENDLY:0 "We accept, though it saddens us that we have to cut our alliance short like this."
 02_ACCEPT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_FRIENDLY:0 "Reluctantly, we accept your proposal. Perhaps our alliance will once more prove fruitful in the future."
 01_ACCEPT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_NEUTRAL:0 "We will look elsewhere for protection then."
 02_ACCEPT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_NEUTRAL:0 "Regrettable as it might be, we accept your terms."
 01_ACCEPT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_HOSTILE:0 "We will look elsewhere for protection then. It is better than having to rely on an unreliable and unwilling overlord."
 02_ACCEPT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_HOSTILE:0 "Your unwillingness to rule simply proves that you are not worth following. The [Root.GetName] is better served looking elsewhere for aid."
 CORP_ACCEPT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "Given the change in the terms of our agreement, please direct all further inquiries to the Department of Foreign Affairs."
 MI_ACCEPT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "Affirmative. After thorough risk analysis, it is clear we will be better served looking elsewhere for diplomatic ties."
 HM_ACCEPT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "The [Root.GetName] can agree to such terms."
 FP_ACCEPT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "At least we will no longer be forced to serve your filthy kind."
 01_REJECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_FRIENDLY:0 "We cannot subject our people to such risks. Reluctantly, we must decline your request."
 02_REJECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_FRIENDLY:0 "We wish to continue this deal, and hope that in time you will understand that it is best for both of us."
 01_REJECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_NEUTRAL:0 "We believe we are better served with our deal intact, even if you do not. We cannot agree to end it."
 02_REJECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_NEUTRAL:0 "We cannot agree to your proposal, as it is not in our best interest."
 01_REJECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_HOSTILE:0 "Though your selfishness exceeds even our low expectations, you are nonetheless more useful to us as an ally than an adversary."
 02_REJECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY_HOSTILE:0 "This deal does not end until we say it ends, you fool."
 CORP_REJECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "Our risk analysts indicate we are better served with this deal intact. If you can sweeten the terms, we might consider it again down the line."
 MI_REJECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "Negative. Risk analysis indicates that despite your lack of trustworthiness, the strength you possess is too valuable to the collective to relinquish."
 HM_REJECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "The [Root.GetName] cannot agree to such an agreement. It would only cause discord."
 FP_REJECT_BREAK_SECRET_FEALTY:0 "Vile scum, we will not let you simply walk away from your obligations."
