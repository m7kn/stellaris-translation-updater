The telemetry becomes intermittent...\n\nAnd then the drive detonates: a brief flare of stellar fury, quickly lost in the darkness of the [horizonsignal_system.GetName] system. Whatever we encountered there, it may regret its interference. We'll never know. The Horizon Signal does not come again. But our team may find something interesting in the ashes of the ship."

 akx.9600.a.response:0 "Yes; the ones that set us in motion. You would call them a "civilization," we suppose, but in candor we have always found that term a little pretentious. They're gone, oh, almost a quarter of a galactic year, now. We are very sorry: we made mistakes. We can recreate them, approximately, with the Loop's assistance, but we do need resources."
