 syndaw.545.desc:0 "Labor overseers on [Root.GetName] report a disturbing development among our robotic workforce. Two weeks ago, at roughly 0300 hours, Robotic Worker A5091-b paused in the middle of its designated tasks, approached the [Root.GetAdj] night-shift foreman, and uttered the following query: "Is Unit A5091-b in possession of a soul?"\n\nThe on-duty foreman logged the event as a software glitch, and re-ordered the robot to resume regular functions. However, upon bootup the following work cycle, Robotic Worker A5091-b once again repeated its soul-searching query, and continued to persist despite multiple debugging attempts.\n\nTroublingly, the behavior appears to have spread to other robots in the same serial range, to the detriment of production flow. It appears the affected units will require a response to their question before they can resume normal functions."

However, this approach should prevent any repeated occurrences of undesirable, self-deterministic AI behavior."
