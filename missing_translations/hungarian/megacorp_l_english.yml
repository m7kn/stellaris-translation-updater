The MegaCorpse initiative was originally developed as a psionic strike force. They would "play" difficult "venues," effectively subverting rebellious movements with overtly anti-corporate lyrics disguising subtle psionic aggression-dampening measures inflicted on the listener.\n\nUltimately, the catalytic effects of their music on the band's already-potent psionic powers soon proved too much for managers and executives to control. The band went rogue in all but name - as Galactic Sounds were unwilling to break a fantastically profitable contract - and today MegaCorpse play whatever and wherever they see fit, as long as it is §Rmetal§!."
