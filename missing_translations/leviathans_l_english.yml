 leviathans.550.name:0 "Voidspawn"
 leviathans.550.desc:1 "If our suspicions hold true, the Voidspawn is far away from home. We believe it is the progeny of an extragalactic predator of unthinkable proportions: one that stalks the void of space in search of its prey. Though we have never before encountered a live specimen, we have heard tales of the destruction and chaos grown Voidspawn leave in their wake. It is said that worlds fester under their shadow."
 leviathans.550.a:0 "$leviathans.510.a$"
 leviathans.550.a.reply:1 "From what we can tell, the mother lays its planet-sized eggs in orbit of a star, where they then incubate for thousands of years, sometimes even long enough to develop an atmosphere and organic life.\n\nThey feed off of living matter, and adult Voidspawn are said to exert a strange influence on all living things. Fortunately this spawn seems to have been abandoned by its parents.\n\nPerhaps it would be best to stifle the creature while it is still young and vulnerable?"
 leviathans.550.b:0 "How is it defeated?"
 leviathans.550.b.reply:0 "We have never heard of a grown Voidspawn being defeated in battle, but this one is newly hatched. The Voidspawn projects corrosive spittle and spikes that can burn through the thickest of armor, but applying a protective acid-proof coating may slow its progress. We will help you make it. The Voidspawn is a threat to us all."
 leviathans.555.name:0 "Scavenger"
 leviathans.555.desc:1 "Ah, the scrap bot. The Scavenger is a curious construct from a lost age. Endlessly it searches through the debris fields of the galaxy, welding the guns, engines, and materials scavenged from countless derelicts onto its own hull. Its mass and firepower have been increasing in such a fashion for centuries, with no sign of relenting.\n\nIt is unknown if there is a limit to how massive it could build itself, given enough time and scrap to work with."
 leviathans.555.a:0 "Who built it, initially?"
 leviathans.555.a.reply:1 "Unfortunately, no definitive data regarding the Scavenger's origin is known to exist. Some researchers believe it to be a malfunctioning scrap collection service machine from a lost empire, its purpose long since muddled by hardware degradation. Others believe it to have originated as a single microscopic nanobot, programmed by some unknown designer to endlessly build itself larger and stronger by exploiting its environment. Still others believe it to have begun as a robotic ship's captain, the sole survivor of an intergalactic battle waged millennia ago, its reasoning systems irrevocably damaged by the sudden destruction of its entire civilization.\n\nOf course, this is all just speculation."
 leviathans.555.b:0 "Can we communicate with it?"
 leviathans.555.b.reply:1 "There have been many attempts at communicating with, or altering the programming of the Scavenger over the years. Unfortunately, most of those expeditions ended up as part of the cosmic scrap yards where the Scavenger bot dwells. Those that were able to outrun it survived. It has welded enough heavy artillery onto its patchwork frame to single-handedly destroy an entire nation's fleet - an event that may already have occurred on more than one occasion.\n\nOf course, any such destructive encounters would only have served to further strengthen the Scavenger, providing it with more ship components to repurpose."
 leviathans.555.c:0 "$leviathans.510.b$"
 leviathans.555.c.reply:1 "As you may have surmised, the Scavenger was not built according to any definitive, pre-existing schematics. As a result, some of its parts fit together... less than optimally, leading to a discrete number of structural weaknesses. Of course, to the uninitiated, most of these are obscured from view, but our advanced sensors have managed to isolate them.\n\nTell your fleets to focus fire on the indicated sections of the Scavenger's hull, and it should substantially impact the amount of damage the construct is able to take before collapsing."
 leviathans.555.aa:0 "Remind us about its origins."
 leviathans.555.bb:0 "Remind us about attempts at communicating with it."
 leviathans.556.name:0 "Tiyanki Matriarch"
 leviathans.556.desc:0 "Magnificent, is she not? A wizened old Matriarch, her hide bleached and hardened by the eons, her tentacles capable of snapping the hulls of battleships like oyster shells. Decades ago, our researchers heard rumors of a captain sworn to hunt the Matriarch to the ends of the galaxy. However, considering her continued existence, we cannot imagine he met with success."
 leviathans.556.a:0 "Why is the Matriarch so much larger than other Tiyanki?"
 leviathans.556.a.reply:0 "Her incredible size is an anomaly, to be sure. We believe the Matriarch is a wanderer from another galaxy in deep space, where a species of Tiyanki far greater in size and strength diverged evolutionarily from the Tiyanki found in our own.\n\nOf course, it is also possible the Matriarch is simply suffering from an advanced form of gigantism - though this would fail to explain her extended lifespan."
 leviathans.556.b:0 "What do you know about the captain hunting the Matriarch?"
 leviathans.556.b.reply:0 "Very little. It is quite possible the captain chased the Matriarch here from another galaxy. Though why one would be foolish enough to challenge a creature capable of destroying entire fleets with just one vessel is beyond us."
 leviathans.556.c:0 "$leviathans.510.b$"
 leviathans.556.c.reply:0 "The Matriarch is formidable, but not indestructible. While her armored hide protects her from a wide range of projectiles, she carries with her a remarkable weakness.\n\nThere is a massive proton torpedo lodged in her back: a wound from a recent battle that has healed poorly. While seemingly defective, our scans of the torpedo suggest it can still be detonated, if agitated with a specific energy pulse.\n\nWe will transmit the details to you now."
