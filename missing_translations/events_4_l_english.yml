 colony_mod.18.name:0 "Magnetic Mystery Revealed"
 colony_mod.18.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is the site of a self-organizing quantum computer of astounding complexity and subtly. The patterns of the weather, the native life, even our own colony is incorporated into it and somehow used as neurons in a planet-sized network. We do not understand how this is possible, and we have no way of controlling it, but we do know that if we arrange our computers in a certain way [Root.GetName] will enhance their performance."

 colony.3001.name:0 "The Mysterious Moon of [Root.GetName]"
 colony.3001.desc:0 "Now that [Root.GetName] has been settled for a while, some data irregularities have been noticed. Specifically, the moon [event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName] does not seem to be made of remotely similar material to [Root.GetName]. This suggests it was not formed at the same time, but rather originally formed elsewhere and somehow was captured by the gravity of [Root.GetName] at a later date. Quite where [event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName] came from is currently a mystery."

 colony.3003.name:0 "Dimensional Travelers"
 colony.3003.desc:0 "Unraveling one mystery has lead to another. We now know that [event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName] was drawn, or was sent, into the orbit of [Root.GetName] from another dimension. Unfortunately, we have no idea why, as besides a slightly different level of background radiation [event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName] seems utterly unremarkable. Still more baffling is how the machinery found at the center of [event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName], which presumably enabled the dimensional shift, works. For now, it might as well be magic."
 colony.3005.name:0 "The Doorway"
 colony.3005.desc:0 "What can only be described as a dimensional portal has been discovered in a remote location on [Root.GetName]. Weather prediction algorithms noticed a strange air current, which was eventually determined to be caused by the slight leakage of atmosphere into the portal. The rate of loss is far too small for it to make any difference to life on [Root.GetName], but the very existence of this portal raises some disturbing questions, such as where does it lead to, and could something come through the portal from the other side?"
 portal_zone_tooltip:0 "The Dimensional Portal can be studied on an ongoing basis."
 colony.3006.name:0 "A Dimension of Suffering"
 colony.3006.spir.desc:1 "The Dimensional Portal on [Root.GetName] seems to lead to a realm of evil and disquiet. Any and all contact with material from this dimension causes intense suffering in the subject, which if continued for more than a few minutes leads to intense suicidal urges coupled with attempts to mutilate their sensory organs. Even simply studying data recorded in the strange dimension causes cascading errors in computer systems, or intense discomfort in sapient beings due to the terrifying realization that one's very soul is being corrupted."
 colony.3006.desc:1 "The Dimensional Portal on [Root.GetName] seems to lead to a realm which is opposed to the sapient mind on a fundamental level. Any and all contact with material from this dimension causes intense suffering in the subject, which if continued for more than a few minutes leads to intense suicidal urges coupled with attempts to mutilate their sensory organs. Even simply studying data recorded in the strange dimension causes intense discomfort in the biological observer, and cascading errors in computer systems."

 colony.3010.name:0 "Doorway Closed"
 colony.3010.desc:0 "The Portal was determined to be able to handle almost unlimited energy input, but the key word is "almost". By generating energy at an unprecedented scale and continuously bombarding the Portal, it was eventually possible to cause it to overload and collapse in on itself. Needless to say, the generation of vast amounts of energy has the potential to be useful in other areas."
 colony.3011.desc:0 "The Portal seemed to react in some way to the thoughts of nearby observers, some more than others. Through a process of elimination it was possible to find a large number of people who were especially potent at influencing the Portal, and together they were able to effectively will the Portal to close. The experience was enlightening and provides strong evidence that it is possible to harness and direct belief in tangible ways."
 colony.3011.psi.desc:0 "The Portal proved to be sensitive to Psionic powers. By collecting a number of Psionically powerful individuals together, they were able to effectively create a Psionic barrier around the portal, preventing any access. The experience was enlightening and provides strong evidence that it is possible to form solid barriers from Psionic energy."
 colony.3012.desc:0 "Sometimes a simple answer is the best answer. After blasting several mountains into gravel and dumping the result into the portal, it seems to have been overloaded. Or, perhaps, was deliberately shut down. Regardless, the remaining material was dumped on top of the site in case it ever re-opens. The experience of such a large engineering and mining project will also prove useful in other areas."
 portal_closed_tooltip:0 "The Portal site can still be studied, but it will provide less useful data."
 colony.3007.desc:1 "The Dimensional Portal on [Root.GetName] leads to a dimension of pure energy, a small amount of which can be siphoned through the portal for our own use. The procedures used to handle discrete "packets" of energy also have potential use as a weapons system."

 colony.3008.name:0 "The Null Void"
 colony.3008.desc:0 "The Dimensional Portal on [Root.GetName] leads to a dimension of pure entropy. It is difficult to even get sensor readings because the very energy of our pings is rapidly dissipated. Our best theory is that this "Null Void" is a dimension where the majority of zero-point energy is negative and so any positive energy which was once present has long since been used up. Knowing this, it might be possible to construct a weapon which can use the Null Void's energy destruction offensively."
 colony.3009.desc:0 "Strangely, the Dimensional Portal on [Root.GetName] seems to connect to a planet which looks very much like [Root.GetName]. Stranger still, there's a signal being broadcast to us through it..."

 colony.3023.desc:0 "Hyperlanes? Perhaps discovering different types of FTL travel was the divergence point between our two universes? Does this mean you are not beset by the Warp beasts?"
 colony.3023.a:0 "No Warp beasts here. Are they a serious threat?"
 colony.3024.desc:0 "The Warp beasts assail every known civilization, they are a threat to all life. As far as we have determined, once Warp travel reached a certain critical level in the galaxy, the Warp beasts awoke and attacked. Several species we know of have already fallen, but so far we are holding them off."
