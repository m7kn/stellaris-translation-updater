 marauder.524.a.desc:0 "Despite concerns that the Great Khan would somehow resurface at the head of a new battle fleet, the utter defeat of the Horde seems to have made that impossible.\n\nAlthough no body has been found, the Great Khan is believed to have died when the last of the Horde's stations and starships were destroyed."
 marauder.524.b.desc:0 "$marauder.524.a.desc$\n\nMeanwhile, our crews have continued to sift through the wreckage of the Khan's former flagship. They found a large blood-stained chair floating in space, and are reasonably certain that this piece of furniture was, in fact, the Great Khan's throne."

 marauder.702.b.desc:0 "After a prolonged period of skirmishing with the §H[marauder_neighbor.GetName]§! along our border, the drone crews of our vessels seem to have developed a certain degree of initiative to counter the often unpredictable tactics employed by the [marauder_neighbor_species.GetNamePlural]. This has led to a general increase in combat efficiency.\n\nThis will eventually have to be dealt with before the crews develop a dangerous level of individuality, but for now it will give us an advantage in any future engagements."
 marauder.702.c.desc:0 "The efficiency of our naval units has increased after a prolonged period of border skirmishing with the §H[marauder_neighbor.GetName]§!. Our units have been forced to make slight alterations to their programming to make up for the unorthodox and unpredictable tactics employed by the [marauder_neighbor_species.GetNamePlural].\n\nIt will eventually become necessary to purge this new data to prevent system degradation in other areas, but for now it will give us an advantage in future engagements."

 marauder.704.desc:0 "A small fleet of derelict [marauder_neighbor_species.GetName] warships was recently discovered in the [border_system.GetName] system, not far from the territory of the §H[marauder_neighbor.GetName]§!. Computer logs on the ships indicate that their crews fled into our space to escape some kind of clan feud. Unfortunately for them, they brought few supplies and soon starved to death. The ships have been adrift ever since.\n\nOur engineers have gone over the ships and they appear to be in decent condition. If they are crewed, we could commission them into service with our own fleet."

Evidently, at some point the §H[marauder_neighbor.GetName]§! attempted to establish a permanent presence in the [border_system.GetName] system, but for whatever reason this endeavour was abandoned.\n\nDue to its close proximity to [border_planet.GetName], the unfinished habitat eluded detection during our initial survey of the system. It is little more than a dense collection of space junk at this point, but there are a lot of valuable minerals among the wreckage that could be salvaged."
